In the corporate world you often hear stories of people working overtime
to make themselves look good. Raises are coming up soon, better stay late!
Get more done!

Not quite. With "knowledge workers," more time worked does not mean more
productivity. At least in the long run.

It's hard to get in the mindset of CEOs/managers that think their employees
that work overtime are more valuable than those that don't. Imagine you have
two developers, one works 8 hour days and the other stays there all night.
Both do roughly the same amount of work. Why reward the guy burning himself out?

Overtime does sometimes need to be done, like when a project manager promises
too much or a server goes down. In this case the person responsible for the
overtime should be punished (as in, let's fix the problem that caused the
overtime.)

For startups the story is similar but often overtime is more justified. In
most cases it should be avoided to give people a chance to think about what
they're doing. However, sometimes though there is a customer demo that just needs to be
pounded out. We're getting to the end of that runway after all!

At the end of the day though, there's nothing like a good night's sleep
to get over the writer's block at work.
