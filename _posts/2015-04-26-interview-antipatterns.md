title: Interview antipatterns
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

As someone who has interviewed developers and as a developer myself, I often think about the interview process.
What is the best way to find great people who can learn?

First I should define what traits it is I am looking for:

- Intelligence -- what you know and how well you learn
- Creativity -- finding solutions that are outside of the proverbial box
- Cultural fit -- not a jerk

In the next sections I'll define some archetypes of interviews, many I have been through, and why they *don't* identify
the traits above. (I am going to skip Cultural fit because it is subjective.)

The estimate screen
---

Google made this type of interview famous. 

- "How many piano tuners are in Chicago?"
- "How many golf balls fit in a school bus?"

Google no longer practices this type of questioning in their interviews. They officially said it had no bearing on the
quality of the candidate.

Many people have trouble estimating things that are large: thousands vs hundreds of thousands vs millions. Having this
ability doesn't seem to be a great indicator of intelligence, just having bearings on large things.

The too hard screen
---

It's tempting to give really hard interview questions to candidates, as this comic illustrates:

It seems obvious but asking really hard questions that don't relate to the job at hand is kind of ridiculous. Also many
of the things they had us do in the Computer Science curriculum we never do again, such as implementing a Binary
Search Tree from scratch. If your candidate does well at this then it might indicate they like to reinvent the wheel.

The whiteboard coding screen
---

Coding not a performance but an interview is. By making your candidate code on a whiteboard, something not normally
done, in front of someone they don't know, that makes it a performance too.

Whenever I think about doing this to a candidate I think about the game Scattergories. I normally have a good
vocabulary but when that timer turns on, I can't remember any words that start with the letter 'P'.

The ideal screen
---

Okay, so the above screens are good at testing:
- Estimation
- Ability to reinvent the wheel
- Performance in front of others

None of which are the skills we set out to find.
